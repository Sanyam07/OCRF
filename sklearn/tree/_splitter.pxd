    # The samples vector `samples` is maintained by the Splitter object such
    # that the samples contained in a node are contiguous. With this setting,
    # `node_split` reorganizes the node samples `samples[start:end]` in two
    # subsets `samples[start:pos]` and `samples[pos:end]`.

    # The 1-d  `features` array of size n_features contains the features
    # indices and allows fast sampling without replacement of features.

    # The 1-d `constant_features` array of size n_features holds in
    # `constant_features[:n_constant_features]` the feature ids with
    # constant values for all the samples that reached a specific node.
    # The value `n_constant_features` is given by the parent node to its
    # child nodes.  The content of the range `[n_constant_features:]` is left
    # undefined, but preallocated for performance reasons
    # This allows optimization with depth-based tree building.
